While developing Swarm AI SaaS application for the lane and asset visualization and intelligence, he provided much needed and valuable contribution to the project through his front-end architecture knowledge and impressive JavaScript/React coding experience. Notably, Bhabaranjan effectively integrated React-vis for several types of slicing and dicing capable analytical graphs. For, UI specific to IoT sensor geospatial data he integrated deck.gl, Kepler.gl, Mapbox, and Uber H3 libraries and developed several React components for our internal uses. If there was something he did not know, he learned quickly, and productize it. He is definitely an amazing frontend developer and overall a great teammate to build beautiful and effective UI. ",
